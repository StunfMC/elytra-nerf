Fabric mod that ports the Elytra changes from 1.18 experimental snapshot 7.

### Changes
- Elytra no longer use up durability when gliding regularly. Durability is now only consumed when a firework rocket is used.
- Speed boosts from firework rockets are slightly weaker.

### Important

Elytra Nerf is required on the server only. Using this mod on a server that doesn't have it installed server-side will simply revert to vanilla behavior.

This project requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) to be installed. I do not have plans to create a Forge or NeoForge port.
